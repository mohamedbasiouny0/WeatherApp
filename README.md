Here is the full, raw Markdown content for your `README.md`. I’ve tailored this specifically to your implementation, highlighting your use of **Cubit** for state management, **Dio** for networking, and the **dynamic theming** logic you wrote.

# 🌦️ WeatherApp - Flutter Cubit Implementation

A professional, real-time weather application built with **Flutter**. This project focuses on clean architecture, efficient state management using **Cubit**, and a reactive UI that adapts to environmental conditions.

---

## 🚀 Key Technical Features

* **State Management (Cubit):** Utilizes `flutter_bloc` (Cubit) to handle UI states (Initial, Loading, Success, and Failure) without the boilerplate of full Blocs.
* **Networking with Dio:** Implements the **Dio** package for robust HTTP requests, featuring better error handling and cleaner syntax than the standard `http` package.
* **Dynamic Theming:** The app's primary color and theme automatically transition based on the current weather condition (e.g., Orange for Sunny, Blue for Cloudy, etc.), providing an immersive user experience.
* **Service-Oriented Architecture:** Logic is separated into a dedicated `WeatherService` for API calls, ensuring the UI remains decoupled from data fetching logic.
* **JSON Serialization:** Data is parsed into a structured `WeatherModel` for type-safe data handling across the app.
